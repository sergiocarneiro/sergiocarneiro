### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been a software engineer for +10 years, developing products end-to-end, with a main focus on mobile.

Passionate about quality, I enjoy working closely with the user experience process, making contributions that solve both technical and intuitive challenges.

I value the process as much as the outcome, as an engaging work life is what drives both personal and collective breakthroughs.

_Spent my first 4 years developing native Android apps; then moved to web apps using Angular and Ionic; then explored game dev with Unity and C# for 2 years; and now I'm back with apps using React and all the new tech._

ðŸ’Ž Acquainted with: Angular, Typescript, No-SQL

ðŸŒ± Currently into: React, Remix, EdgeDB, Cloudflare
