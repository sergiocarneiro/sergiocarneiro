### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been a software engineer for +9 years of experience, co-founded of a software company currently dedicated to the food industry.

I'm also engaged in the user experience process and believe that user-centric development is the key to success.

Both UX and DX are very important to me. I value clean code and documentation, readable to everyone from all skill levels, and love to share knowledge with them.

_Spent my first 4 years developing native Android apps; then moved to web apps using Angular and Ionic; then explored game dev with Unity and C# for 2 years; and now I'm back with apps using React and all the new tech._

ðŸ’Ž Acquainted with: Angular, Typescript, No-SQL

ðŸŒ± Currently into: React, Remix, EdgeDB, Cloudflare
